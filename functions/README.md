# OCI Functions with OCI Code Editor

## Introduction

You can now create/edit OCI Functions on the go with OCI Code Editor with out any external or local IDE.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Functions is a serverless platform that lets developers create, run, and scale applications without managing any infrastructure. Functions integrate with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, platform services and SaaS applications. Because Functions is based on the open source Fn Project, developers can create applications that can be easily ported to other cloud and on-premises environments. Code based on Functions typically runs for short durations, and customers pay only for the resources they use.
